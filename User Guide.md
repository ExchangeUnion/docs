This guide is written for individuals looking to buy and sell ("swap", "exchange", "trade") cryptocurrency on OpenDEX.

There are two ways to go about it:
1. Use an [OpenDEX-enabled exchange](https://opendex.network/trade/exchanges). **The recommended and by far the easiest way** to get the job done. Benefit from an easy-to-use website, no-account and no-KYC policy and trade directly from your (mobile) wallet, always in full control over your assets. Lightning supported.
2. Use `xud` to trade on OpenDEX directly. Not trivial to set up and operate, but offers the full feature set of OpenDEX (e.g. instant settlement).

If you decided for #2, running xud directly, follow [this guide for market makers](Market%20Maker%20Guide.md). It explains how to use [`xud-docker`](https://github.com/ExchangeUnion/xud-docker), the recommended way to set up a full `xud` trading environment. You can skip all market-maker specific steps, like connecting to an external exchange and don't necessarily need a separate box if you want to just trade occasionally.
