This guide is written for individuals looking to buy and sell ("swap", "exchange", "trade") cryptocurrency on the OpenDEX network.

There are two ways to go about it:

1. Use an [OpenDEX-enabled exchange](https://opendex.network/trade/exchanges). **The recommended and by far the easiest way** to get the job done. Benefit from an easy-to-use website, no-account and no-KYC policy and trade directly from your (mobile) wallet, always in full control over your assets. Lightning supported.
2. Use `xud` to trade on OpenDEX directly. Not trivial to set up and operate, but offers the full feature set of OpenDEX (e.g. instant settlement). Follow [this guide](Market%20Maker%20Guide.md).
